# Opportunties in the lab

## Prospective postdocs

To inquire about potential postdoc opportunities, please email with a CV and a statement of interest that briefly describes your research experiences and interests, your postdoctoral training goals, and how working in our group is a good fit to advance those goals.

I encourage potential postdocs to consider applying for independent funding and am happy to help develop project ideas for postdoc fellowships. Please reach out to write a fellowship together.

## Prospective graduate students

Prospective graduate students can join the lab for a graduate degree (M.Sc. or Ph.D.) through the  Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology [graduate program](https://eeb.ku.edu/graduate-programs){:target="_blank"}. The prospective student must identify a faculty mentor [before applying](https://eeb.ku.edu/how-apply){:target="_blank"}. Prospective students can send an email with their CV and a description of your research interests (and how working with us would help you meet these interests).

I am currently accepting graduate students to join my lab. Please check the following [link]({{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl}}/docs/ChoiLab_KU_PhD_Recruitment_Ad_2024.pdf){:target="_blank"} for specific information on applying for a graduate position in the lab.

## Prospective undergraduates

If youâ€™re interested in lab research please email with a few sentences on your background (e.g. major), what about the lab interests you, and what you would like to accomplish.
