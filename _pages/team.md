### Jae Young Choi (PI)

Jae is an Assistant Professor in Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas. He received his Ph.D. from Cornell University and was a postdoc at New York University. Jae is interested in combining population and functional genomics to understand the evolution and function of the natural variation observed within plant populations.

### Surbhi Kumawat (Postdoctoral researcher)

Surbhi received her Ph.D. from Panjab University studying the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and conducted plant phenomics study to investigate the effects of silicon supplementation in presence of heavy metal stress. She is a plant functional geneticist who combines quantitative genetics and genome editing to understand the molecular basis of plant traits.

### Askhan Shametov (Graduate student)
Khan is a Ph.D. graduate student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He received a MSc from the University of Minnesota. He is interested in understanding the genomic basis of ecological and morphological diversification of Metrosideros across the Hawaiian islands. Ultimately interested in elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptive radiation allows us to understand how biological diversity arise and promote sustainable conservation strategies.
